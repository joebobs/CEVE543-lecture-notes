abstract = {Abstract We investigate the applicability of deep learning (DL) methods for reconstructing daily weather data. Inspired by video inpainting, we propose a novel method, WeRec3D, which utilizes a three-dimensional convolutional neural network. Our approach was developed iteratively by evaluating seven modeling improvement techniques. The resulting method reduces the validation error by 67\% compared to a two-dimensional baseline, decreasing the error from RMSE = 0.4620 and MAE = 0.311 to RMSE = 0.1527 and MAE = 0.1093. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of the spatial distribution of observations on reconstruction accuracy and propose a potential integration with the analogue resampling method. WeRec3D is trained and validated in a self-supervised manner using ERA5's surface temperature and pressure data over Europe. On a hold-out set from 1950 to 1954, the validation results in an MAE of 1.11°C and 199 Pa. As a case study, we reconstruct the 1807 heat wave and validate it using a leave-one-out method in space. Compared to the original data, the reconstructed time series exhibit a correlation of at least 0.91, with a maximum normalized RMSE and standard deviation delta of 0.58 and 0.51 respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply DL-based video inpainting techniques for weather reconstruction, proposing it as a novel approach for reconstructing missing weather information.},

abstract = {The geo-statistical Kriging method is conventionally used in the spatial dimension to predict missing values in a series by utilizing information from neighbouring data, supported by the hypothesis that mathematical expectation is a function of distance between observations. By using a data-driven machine learning-based inferencing and exploration framework, this research applies a Kriging-based interpolation in the temporal dimension to fill in data gaps in time-series of air temperatures. It assesses its performance for artificial gap scenarios (ranging in length from single one to six consecutive data points) generated using data with both daily and hourly resolutions from five sites in Europe (Laqueuille, France; Grillenburg, Germany; Monte Bondone, Italy; Oensingen, Switzerland; Rothamsted, United Kingdom) and one in France overseas (Sedael, Réunion Island). Results show that the method is capable of predicting missing temperatures with acceptable accuracy, especially with the hourly resolution and for non-high elevation sites: modeling efficiency (EF≤1, optimum) >0.8, with the exception of Monte Bondone, placed at >2000ma.s.l. (EF<0). With daily data, maximum temperature was correctly predicted at all sites (0.6≤EF<0.9), while some less accuracy (down to EF<0.4) was noted when predicting missing daily minimum temperatures. In conclusion, the method appears suitable to be applied to fill in hourly temperature gaps, requiring more stringent hypotheses concerning daily data and mountain sites (but further studies are required to draw concluding recommendations).}
